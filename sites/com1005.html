                In this module we take a more focused look into Artificial Intelligence.
                We look of the history of AI, Intelligent Agents and other types of agents.
                Now we are currently having a look at vision and machines which are using vision. 
                This module is also very interesting due to it having put the focus on AI.
                I know it sounds like I am being censored, but really so far all the modules are truly very interesting.<br>
                The practical part of this module is to do with robot dogs in simulation.
                We have to write code to make them solve different tasks. 
                They can be a bit buggy which makes working with them a bit difficult, but that is just preparing us for life after university.
                Everything is not perfectly simulated and does not work exactly as you would want.
                So for me they are actually very fun and challenging which is always good.
                And who does not like working on robots, they are just so much fun.<br>
                On the right you can see our group's robot at the exact moment when it detected the stop sign.
