                As you probably already guessed this module focuses on the web. 
                Currently we are in the proccess of making a website and DING DING DING!
                You guessed it, this website IS the assignment for the module.
                But how is the module?
                Well, I was not really looking that forward to this class as I did not like web development at all.
                But my lecturers, as it turns out, really fun and can make the module really interesting.
                Since my A-Levels I have had a massive improvement in my web development skills and now I have really enjoyed making this website.
                So lets hope that my lecturers like my website as much as I do, because I feel like my website is quite nice for a complete beginner.<br>
                Mostly in this module we focus on learning the code need to build a website.
                As there have not been any other projects and I cannot think of any picture that would demonstrate the module, I decided to post an illustrative picture.
                That picture demonstrates me complaining to my friends about HTML not functioning, when indeed it is.
